/**
 * The model used for when a request throws an error. This model was introduced in order to provide
 * a standardized way of handling the error responses that a request can return.
 * 
 * If the error JSON received from the server includes the words "error" or "message", then the
 * values of those keys will be added to the [errors] array. If the error is not a JSON dictionary,
 * then JSON String will be added to the [errors] array.
 * 
 * If any type of messages are received, then they will be added according to the same rule above
 * after the errors found above.
